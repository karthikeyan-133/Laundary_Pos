# Troubleshooting Summary for 404 NOT_FOUND Error

## Problem Identified
You're experiencing a 404 NOT_FOUND error with the following details:
```
404: NOT_FOUND
Code: NOT_FOUND
ID: bom1::jv6t8-1758443024900-04e8a60f6287
```

## Root Cause Analysis
The 404 error indicates that Vercel is not properly routing requests to your endpoints. This could be due to:
1. Incorrect routing configuration in vercel.json
2. Missing or incorrectly named files
3. Environment variables not properly set in Vercel dashboard

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Added Diagnostic Endpoints
We've created several diagnostic endpoints to help identify the root cause:

1. **Routing Debug Endpoint**: `/api/routing-debug`
   - Shows detailed information about how Vercel routes requests
   - Helps identify configuration issues

2. **Full Environment Test**: `/api/full-env-test`
   - Comprehensive test of environment variables and database connectivity
   - Provides detailed error information

3. **Detailed Database Connection Test**: `/api/db-connection-test`
   - Tests multiple database connection configurations
   - Provides specific error codes and messages

### 2. Updated Configuration Files
1. **vercel.json**: Added routes for all new diagnostic endpoints
2. **server.js**: Added a test server endpoint to verify Express server is working
3. **Documentation**: Updated troubleshooting guides with detailed steps

## Next Steps for You

### Step 1: Test the Routing Debug Endpoint
Visit this URL in your browser:
```
https://pos-laundry-backend.vercel.app/api/routing-debug
```

This will show you:
- The exact URL Vercel is receiving
- Request headers and method
- Environment variables available to your application

### Step 2: Check Environment Variables
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings > Environment Variables
3. Ensure these variables are set:
   ```
   DB_HOST=your_database_host
   DB_USER=your_database_user
   DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
   DB_NAME=Pos_system
   DB_PORT=3306
   ```

### Step 3: Test Other Diagnostic Endpoints
After confirming routing is working:
1. Test environment variables: `/api/test-env`
2. Test full environment: `/api/full-env-test`
3. Test database connection: `/api/db-connection-test`

### Step 4: Check Vercel Function Logs
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Click on the "Functions" tab
3. Look for any functions with errors
4. Check the detailed logs for error messages

## Expected Outcomes

### If Routing Debug Works
- You should see a JSON response with request details
- This confirms Vercel routing is configured correctly

### If Environment Tests Show Missing Variables
- Set the required environment variables in Vercel dashboard
- Redeploy your application

### If Database Tests Fail
- Verify your database credentials
- Ensure your database accepts connections from Vercel
- Check SSL settings if applicable

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "File not found" in Vercel logs
**Solution**: 
- Verify file paths in vercel.json match actual file locations
- Ensure all serverless function files are in the correct directories

### Issue: "Module not found" errors
**Solution**:
- Check that all dependencies are listed in package.json
- Ensure package-lock.json is up to date

### Issue: Environment variables not loading
**Solution**:
- Set variables in Vercel dashboard, not in .env files
- Verify variable names match what your code expects

## When to Seek Further Help

If after following these steps you still experience issues:
1. Share the output from the routing-debug endpoint
2. Include any error messages from Vercel function logs
3. Provide details about your database configuration
4. Share the results from all diagnostic endpoints

This information will help identify the specific cause of your deployment issues.
