# CORS Issue Fix Summary

## Problem
The Tally POS application was experiencing CORS errors when deployed to Vercel:
- Frontend: https://pos-laundry-tau.vercel.app
- Backend: https://pos-laundry-backend.vercel.app

Error messages:
```
Access to fetch at 'https://pos-laundry-backend.vercel.app/api/orders' from origin 'https://pos-laundry-tau.vercel.app' has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
```

## Root Causes
1. **Backend CORS Configuration**: The backend server was not configured to allow requests from the frontend domain `https://pos-laundry-tau.vercel.app`
2. **Frontend API Configuration**: The frontend was hardcoded to use an incorrect backend URL
3. **Returns Router CORS Conflict**: The returns router had its own CORS configuration that conflicted with the main server CORS setup
4. **Vercel Routing Configuration**: The vercel.json routing configuration had unnecessary routes

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Backend CORS Configuration (backend-new/server.js)
- Added `https://pos-laundry-backend.vercel.app` to the list of allowed origins
- Updated the allowedOrigins array to include the actual backend URL

### 2. Frontend API Configuration (frontend/src/services/api.ts)
- Updated the getApiBaseUrl function to use the correct backend URL: `https://pos-laundry-backend.vercel.app`
- Removed hardcoded reference to `https://billing-pos-yjh9.vercel.app`

### 3. Returns Router CORS (backend-new/returns.js)
- Removed the conflicting CORS middleware from the returns router
- The main server CORS configuration now handles all routes properly

### 4. Vercel Configuration (vercel.json)
- Removed the unnecessary `/api/test` route that was pointing to a separate test file
- Simplified routing to properly handle API requests

### 5. Environment Configuration
- Updated frontend/.env.production to use relative paths instead of hardcoded URLs
- This allows the application to work correctly in different deployment environments

## Testing
After applying these fixes:
1. The CORS errors should be resolved
2. The frontend should be able to communicate with the backend API
3. All API endpoints (products, customers, orders, returns, settings) should work correctly

## Deployment
To deploy these changes:
1. Commit all changes to your repository
2. Push to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket
3. Vercel will automatically deploy the updated application
4. Alternatively, run the deploy script: `./deploy.sh` or `deploy.bat`

## Additional Notes
- The local development environment remains unchanged and should continue to work
- The changes are backward compatible with existing deployments
- No database schema changes were required
