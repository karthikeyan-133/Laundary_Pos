# Sales Report Data Visibility Fixes

## Issues Identified

1. **Date Filtering Issues**: The date filtering in the reports section was not properly handling time zones, which could cause orders to be filtered out incorrectly.

2. **Product Price Display**: The receipt generation and item reports were still referencing the old `price` field instead of the new service-specific rate fields (`ironRate`, `washAndIronRate`, `dryCleanRate`).

3. **Service-Specific Pricing**: The reports were not correctly displaying prices based on the selected service for each item.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Date Handling
- Improved date conversion to properly handle Dubai time zone (UTC+4)
- Added better error handling for invalid dates
- Ensured consistent date comparison in the filtering logic

### 2. Service-Specific Pricing in Reports
- Updated the "Report by Item" section to correctly display prices based on the service selected for each item
- Modified the receipt generation function to show the correct price based on service
- Added logic to fall back to `ironRate` when no service is specified

### 3. Improved Data Validation
- Added better validation for order items and product data
- Enhanced error logging to help diagnose issues
- Added checks for missing or invalid data structures

## Files Modified

1. `frontend/src/components/Reports.tsx`:
   - Updated date filtering logic
   - Fixed price display in "Report by Item" section
   - Fixed price display in receipt generation function

2. `frontend/src/hooks/usePOSStore.ts`:
   - Enhanced date conversion functions
   - Improved order data type conversion

## How to Test the Fixes

1. Make sure the backend is running:
   ```
   cd backend-new
   npm start
   ```

2. Start the frontend:
   ```
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Create some test orders with different services to verify the reports display correctly

4. Check the reports section to ensure:
   - Orders are displayed correctly in the date range
   - Item prices are shown based on the selected service
   - Receipts print with the correct pricing information

## Expected Results

After applying these fixes:
- Sales data should be visible in all report sections
- Prices should correctly reflect the service selected for each item
- Date filtering should work properly with Dubai time zone
- Receipts should display accurate pricing information
