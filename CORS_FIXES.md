# CORS Fixes for Vercel Deployment

## Issues Identified

1. **Double slash in API URLs**: The frontend was making requests to URLs like `https://pos-laundry-backend.vercel.app//api/products` (note the double slash)
2. **CORS configuration conflicts**: Multiple CORS configurations in the backend that were conflicting
3. **Vercel routing configuration**: The vercel.json routes might be causing redirect issues
4. **Environment variable mismatch**: The frontend was trying to access the wrong backend URL

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Frontend API Service (`frontend/src/services/api.ts`)

- Added URL normalization to prevent double slashes
- Improved origin handling for Vercel deployments
- Added better error handling and logging

### 2. Backend CORS Configuration (`backend-new/server.js`)

- Updated allowed origins to include the correct frontend domains:
  - `https://pos-laundry-ajish.vercel.app` (previous domain)
  - `https://pos-laundry-eight.vercel.app` (current domain)
  - `https://pos-laundry-tau.vercel.app` (production domain)
- Simplified CORS configuration to avoid conflicts
- Removed conflicting separate CORS handler
- Ensured all API endpoints properly set CORS headers

### 3. Vercel Configuration (`vercel.json`)

- Simplified routes to properly direct all API requests to the backend
- Removed specific route definitions that might cause conflicts
- Ensured all `/api/*` routes are handled by the main server.js file

### 4. Environment Configuration (`frontend/.env`)

- Updated comments to clarify the production deployment setup
- Ensured proper fallback URLs for different environments

## Testing the Fix

1. Deploy both frontend and backend to Vercel
2. Visit your frontend URL: `https://pos-laundry-eight.vercel.app`
3. The API requests should now work without CORS errors

## Additional Notes

- The CORS test page at `/cors-test.html` can be used to verify the fix
- Make sure both frontend and backend are deployed to the correct Vercel projects
- Check that the environment variables are properly set in Vercel

## Common Issues and Solutions

1. **If you still see CORS errors**:
   - Verify that `https://pos-laundry-eight.vercel.app` is in the allowed origins list in `server.js`
   - Check the browser console for specific error messages
   - Ensure both frontend and backend are deployed and accessible

2. **If API requests still fail**:
   - Check that the backend is running and accessible at `https://pos-laundry-backend.vercel.app`
   - Verify database connections are working
   - Check Vercel logs for any deployment errors
