# Frontend-Backend Connection Fix

## Issue Summary
The frontend was unable to connect to the backend API due to two main issues:
1. Port mismatch: Frontend was trying to connect to port 3005, but backend was running on port 3001
2. Proxy configuration was pointing to the wrong port

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated Vite Proxy Configuration
**File**: `frontend/vite.config.ts`
- Changed proxy target from `http://localhost:3005` to `http://localhost:3001`

### 2. Updated Frontend Environment Variables
**File**: `frontend/.env`
- Set `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001` for local development
- Commented out the Vercel deployment URL to avoid conflicts in local development

### 3. Restarted Both Servers
- Killed any processes using port 3001
- Started backend server on port 3001
- Started frontend server (which automatically picked up the new proxy configuration)

## Verification
Connection has been verified with a test request to `/api/test-server` which returned a successful response:
```json
{
  "message": "Server test successful",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-23T11:14:40.925Z",
  "server": "Express server is running correctly"
}
```

## Next Steps
1. Access the frontend at http://localhost:8083
2. The authentication and API calls should now work correctly
3. For production deployment, update the VITE_API_URL in the .env file to point to your deployed backend URL
