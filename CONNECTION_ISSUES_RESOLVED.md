# Connection Issues Resolved

## Overview
This document summarizes the issues identified and resolved to fix the connection problems between the Tally POS frontend and backend.

## Issues Identified

1. **Port Mismatch**: Frontend was trying to connect to backend on port 3005, but backend was running on port 3001
2. **Network Errors**: "net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED" errors in browser console
3. **Authentication Failures**: Token verification failing due to incorrect endpoint URLs
4. **API Request Failures**: All data loading (products, customers, orders) failing

## Root Cause
The frontend application was configured with an incorrect default port (3005) for local development, while the backend server was configured to run on port 3001.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Frontend API Configuration Updated
**File:** [frontend/src/services/api.ts](file:///C:/Users/TECHZON-17/Desktop/Tally_Pos/frontend/src/services/api.ts)

Changed the default local development port from 3005 to 3001:
```typescript
// Before
return 'http://localhost:3005';

// After
return 'http://localhost:3001';
```

### 2. Frontend Authentication Context Updated
**File:** [frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx](file:///C:/Users/TECHZON-17/Desktop/Tally_Pos/frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx)

Updated the token verification endpoint to use the correct port:
```typescript
// Before
const response = await fetch('http://localhost:3005/api/auth/verify', {

// After
const verifyUrl = AUTH_API_BASE_URL ? 
  `${AUTH_API_BASE_URL}/api/auth/verify` : 
  '/api/auth/verify';
const response = await fetch(verifyUrl, {
```

### 3. Backend Server Configuration Verified
**File:** [backend-new/server.js](file:///C:/Users/TECHZON-17/Desktop/Tally_Pos/backend-new/server.js)

Confirmed backend is properly configured to run on port 3001:
```javascript
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3001;
```

## Testing Results

✅ **Backend Server**: Running successfully on port 3001
✅ **Health Check**: Responding with database connected status
✅ **Frontend**: Running successfully on port 8080
✅ **API Endpoints**: All accessible without network errors
✅ **Authentication**: Token verification working correctly
✅ **Data Loading**: Products, customers, orders loading successfully

## How to Verify the Fix

1. Start the full application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. Open your browser to http://localhost:8080

3. Check the browser console for successful API requests (no more ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED errors)

4. You should be able to:
   - Access the login/signup pages
   - Authenticate successfully
   - Load product, customer, and order data
   - Perform all POS operations

## Additional Test Files Created

1. **Connection Test**: [frontend/src/services/connection-test.ts](file:///C:/Users/TECHZON-17/Desktop/Tally_Pos/frontend/src/services/connection-test.ts)
   - Verifies frontend can connect to backend health endpoint

2. **Authentication Test**: [frontend/src/services/auth-test.ts](file:///C:/Users/TECHZON-17/Desktop/Tally_Pos/frontend/src/services/auth-test.ts)
   - Verifies authentication endpoints are accessible

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter connection issues:

1. **Verify both servers are running**:
   - Frontend should be on port 8080
   - Backend should be on port 3001

2. **Check the health endpoint**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3001/health
   ```

3. **Verify Supabase credentials** in [backend-new/.env](file:///C:/Users/TECHZON-17/Desktop/Tally_Pos/backend-new/.env)

4. **Check browser console** for any remaining errors

## Conclusion

All connection issues between the frontend and backend have been resolved. The application should now function correctly in local development mode with proper communication between all components.
