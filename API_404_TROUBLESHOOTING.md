# API 404 Error Troubleshooting Guide

This guide will help you resolve the 404 "NOT_FOUND" errors you're experiencing with your API endpoints on Vercel.

## Current Issue Analysis

The error messages show:
```
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 ()
API response from https://laundary-pos.vercel.app/api/customers: 404 
API error from https://laundary-pos.vercel.app/api/customers: The page could not be found
```

This indicates that:
1. Your frontend is now correctly trying to access the API at the same domain (`https://laundary-pos.vercel.app`)
2. However, the API endpoints are returning 404 errors, meaning Vercel can't find the routes

## Root Causes

The 404 errors are typically caused by:

1. **Incorrect Vercel routing configuration** - The routes in `vercel.json` are not properly directing API requests to your backend
2. **Missing functions configuration** - Vercel needs to know how to handle your Node.js serverless functions
3. **Path issues** - The paths in your routing configuration might be incorrect
4. **Build issues** - The backend might not be properly built or deployed

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Verify Vercel Configuration

Your `vercel.json` has been updated with the correct configuration:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "frontend/package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/static-build",
      "config": {
        "distDir": "dist"
      }
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/api/(.*)",
      "dest": "/backend-new/server.js",
      "methods": ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "OPTIONS"]
    },
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/frontend/dist/$1"
    }
  ],
  "functions": {
    "backend-new/server.js": {
      "memory": 1024,
      "maxDuration": 10
    }
  },
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/api/(.*)",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "Access-Control-Allow-Origin",
          "value": "*"
        }
        // ... other headers
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Key changes made:
1. Added `functions` configuration for the backend
2. Fixed the destination paths to start with `/`
3. Removed the duplicate backend build configuration

### Solution 2: Redeploy Your Application

1. Commit the changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Vercel configuration for API routing"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. Go to your Vercel dashboard and trigger a new deployment

### Solution 3: Test API Endpoints

After redeployment, test these endpoints:

1. **Health Check**: `https://your-deployment-url.vercel.app/api/health-check`
2. **CORS Check**: `https://your-deployment-url.vercel.app/api/cors-check`
3. **Debug CORS**: `https://your-deployment-url.vercel.app/api/debug-cors`

These should return JSON responses instead of 404 errors.

### Solution 4: Check Vercel Logs

1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Find your project
3. Go to the Deployments tab
4. Click on the latest deployment
5. Check the logs for any errors during build or runtime

### Solution 5: Verify File Structure

Make sure your file structure looks like this:
```
project-root/
├── frontend/
│   ├── dist/
│   ├── package.json
│   └── ...
├── backend-new/
│   ├── server.js
│   ├── package.json
│   └── ...
├── vercel.json
└── ...
```

### Solution 6: Manual Testing

You can also test your backend locally:

1. In the `backend-new` directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend-new
   npm start
   ```

2. Visit `http://localhost:3001/api/health-check` to verify it's working locally

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. API requests should return proper JSON responses instead of 404 errors
2. No more "The page could not be found" messages
3. All data should load correctly in the frontend

## If Issues Persist

1. Check Vercel deployment logs for specific error messages
2. Verify that your `vercel.json` file is in the root directory
3. Ensure that `backend-new/server.js` exports the app correctly with `module.exports = app;`
4. Check that all required dependencies are in `backend-new/package.json`
