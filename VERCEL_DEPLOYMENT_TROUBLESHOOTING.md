# Vercel Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

This guide will help you resolve the deployment failures you're experiencing with your Vercel projects.

## Current Issue Analysis

The error messages show:
```
All checks have failed
2 failing checks

Vercel – laundary-pos - Deployment failed.
Vercel – laundary-pos-zb3p - Deployment failed.
```

This indicates that Vercel is unable to successfully build and deploy your application.

## Root Causes

Deployment failures are typically caused by:

1. **Incorrect project structure** - Files not in the expected locations
2. **Misconfigured vercel.json** - Routing or build configurations that don't match your project
3. **Dependency issues** - Missing or incorrect dependencies
4. **Build script problems** - Commands that fail during the build process
5. **Environment variable issues** - Missing or incorrect environment variables

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Verify Project Structure

Your project should have this structure:
```
project-root/
├── frontend/
│   ├── package.json
│   ├── dist/ (created during build)
│   └── ...
├── backend-new/
│   ├── server.js
│   ├── vercel-entry.js
│   ├── package.json
│   └── ...
├── vercel.json
└── ...
```

### Solution 2: Check Vercel Configuration

Your `vercel.json` has been updated with the correct configuration:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "frontend/package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/static-build",
      "config": {
        "distDir": "frontend/dist"
      }
    },
    {
      "src": "backend-new/vercel-entry.js",
      "use": "@vercel/node"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/api/(.*)",
      "dest": "backend-new/vercel-entry.js"
    },
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "frontend/dist/$1"
    }
  ]
}
```

Key changes made:
1. Using `frontend/dist` as the distDir (with the full path)
2. Using `backend-new/vercel-entry.js` as the backend entry point
3. Simplified the configuration to match Vercel's expectations

### Solution 3: Check Dependencies

Ensure both frontend and backend have their dependencies installed:

1. In the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. In the backend-new directory:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Solution 4: Test Build Locally

Before deploying, test the builds locally:

1. Frontend build:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run build
   ```

2. Backend verification:
   ```bash
   cd backend-new
   node vercel-entry.js
   ```

### Solution 5: Check Vercel Dashboard

1. Go to your Vercel dashboard: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find your projects (laundary-pos and laundary-pos-zb3p)
3. Check the deployment logs for specific error messages
4. Look for:
   - Build errors
   - Dependency installation issues
   - Routing problems

### Solution 6: Environment Variables

Make sure your environment variables are correctly set in the Vercel dashboard:

1. Go to each project's settings
2. Navigate to Environment Variables
3. Ensure these variables are set for the backend:
   - `DB_HOST`
   - `DB_USER`
   - `DB_PASSWORD`
   - `DB_NAME`
   - `DB_PORT`
   - `JWT_SECRET`

### Solution 7: Redeploy with Clean Cache

1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Find your projects
3. Go to the Deployments tab
4. Click "Redeploy" and select "Ignore Cache"

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. Vercel deployments should complete successfully
2. No more "Deployment failed" errors
3. API endpoints should return proper responses instead of 404 errors
4. Frontend should load and communicate with the backend correctly

## If Issues Persist

1. Check Vercel deployment logs for specific error messages
2. Verify that your GitHub repository has the correct file structure
3. Ensure all dependencies are properly listed in package.json files
4. Check that the vercel-entry.js file exists in the backend-new directory
5. Make sure environment variables are correctly set in the Vercel dashboard
