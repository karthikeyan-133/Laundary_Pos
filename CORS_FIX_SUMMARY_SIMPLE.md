# CORS Configuration Fix Summary

## Problem
The backend server was experiencing CORS issues when communicating with the frontend at https://pos-laundry-tau.vercel.app. The configuration needed to be updated to properly handle CORS requests.

## Solution
I've created an updated version of the server.js file with the following improvements:

### 1. Simplified CORS Configuration
- Updated the CORS configuration to match the reference code pattern
- Maintained all necessary allowed origins:
  - Local development servers (localhost:5173, localhost:5174, etc.)
  - Production frontend (https://pos-laundry-tau.vercel.app)
  - Alternative deployments (https://billing-pos-yjh9.vercel.app)
  - Backend URL (https://pos-laundry-backend.vercel.app)

### 2. Clear CORS Endpoint Markers
- Added clear comments (âœ…) to identify CORS-related code
- Included both `/api/test` and `/api/cors-check` endpoints for testing

### 3. Proper Preflight Handling
- Ensured OPTIONS requests are properly handled with `app.options('*', cors(corsOptions))`

### 4. File Structure
- Created `server-simple.js` which maintains all existing functionality but with cleaner CORS configuration
- Kept the original `server.js` file intact for reference

## Files Created
1. `backend-new/server-simple.js` - Simplified version with improved CORS configuration
2. `CORS_FIX_SUMMARY_SIMPLE.md` - This summary file

## Testing
To test the CORS configuration:
1. Deploy the updated server code
2. Visit https://pos-laundry-tau.vercel.app
3. Check browser console for CORS errors (should be resolved)
4. Test API endpoints to ensure they're working correctly

## Notes
- The simplified version maintains all existing database functionality
- All routes and API endpoints remain unchanged
- The CORS configuration now properly handles both development and production environments
