# Tally POS System - Connection Fixes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to fix the connection issues between the frontend and backend of the Tally POS system.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend CORS Configuration (backend-new/server.js)
- Updated CORS configuration to allow multiple origins including:
  - `http://localhost:5173` (Default Vite development server)
  - `http://localhost:5174` (Alternative Vite development server)
  - `http://127.0.0.1:5173` (Alternative localhost)
  - `http://127.0.0.1:5174` (Alternative localhost)
  - `https://pos-laundry-tau.vercel.app` (Production frontend)
  - `https://billing-pos-yjh9.vercel.app` (Alternative frontend)
  - `https://pos-laundry-backend.vercel.app` (Current backend URL)

### 2. Frontend Environment Configuration (frontend/.env)
- Added `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3004` to connect to the backend server

### 3. Frontend API Service (frontend/src/services/api.ts)
- Updated the API base URL detection to use the correct backend URL
- Updated to use `https://pos-laundry-backend.vercel.app` for Vercel deployments

### 4. Returns Router CORS Configuration (backend-new/returns.js)
- Removed conflicting CORS middleware that was causing issues with the main server CORS setup

### 5. Vercel Configuration (vercel.json)
- Removed unnecessary routes that were causing routing conflicts

### 6. Project Documentation
- Created comprehensive README.md files for both frontend and backend
- Added root README.md with setup instructions
- Created test scripts to verify connections

### 7. Development Scripts
- Created package.json in root directory with scripts to run both frontend and backend simultaneously
- Added test scripts to verify connections
- Added individual scripts to run frontend or backend separately
- Added deployment scripts for easier Vercel deployment

## Testing the Connection

### Automated Testing
Run the following command from the root directory to test the connection:
```bash
npm test
```

### Manual Testing
1. Start both frontend and backend servers:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5173

3. The frontend should be able to communicate with the backend and display data

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **CORS Errors**
   - Ensure the backend CORS configuration allows your frontend origin
   - Check that both servers are running
   - Verify the `VITE_API_URL` in the frontend `.env` file matches the backend URL
   - Make sure the returns router doesn't have conflicting CORS configuration
   - Check that the vercel.json routing configuration is correct

2. **Database Connection Issues**
   - Verify your MySQL database is running
   - Check the database credentials in the backend `.env` file
   - Ensure the database schema has been created

3. **Port Conflicts**
   - The backend runs on port 3004 by default
   - The frontend runs on port 5173 by default
   - If these ports are in use, the applications will try alternative ports

### Testing Scripts

1. **Root directory test**: `npm test` - Verifies directory structure and configuration files
2. **Frontend test**: `cd frontend && npm run test-connection` - Verifies frontend configuration
3. **Backend test**: `cd backend-new && npm run test-connection` - Tests database connection

## Running the Application

### Development Mode
To run both frontend and backend in development mode:
```bash
npm start
```

### Individual Components
To run only the frontend:
```bash
npm run frontend
```

To run only the backend:
```bash
npm run backend
```

### Manual Start
Alternatively, you can start each component manually:

1. Backend:
   ```bash
   cd backend-new
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Frontend:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

## Environment Variables

### Backend (.env)
- `DB_HOST` - Database host (default: localhost)
- `DB_USER` - Database user (default: root)
- `DB_PASSWORD` - Database password (default: empty)
- `DB_NAME` - Database name (default: Pos_system)
- `DB_PORT` - Database port (default: 3306)
- `PORT` - Server port (default: 3004)

### Frontend (.env)
- `VITE_API_URL` - Backend API URL (default: http://localhost:3004)
