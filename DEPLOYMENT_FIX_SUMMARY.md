# Vercel Deployment Fix Summary

## Problem
The Tally POS system was experiencing deployment failures on Vercel with "All checks have failed" errors for both frontend and backend deployments.

## Root Cause
The deployment failures were caused by conflicts between serverless functions in the `backend-new/api` directory and the Express server. Having both approaches for handling API requests created routing conflicts and configuration issues in the Vercel environment.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Removed Conflicting Serverless Functions
Deleted all serverless functions from the `backend-new/api` directory:
- `cors-test.js`
- `customers.js`
- `health.js`
- `orders.js`
- `products.js`
- `returns.js`
- `settings.js`
- `test-db.js`
- `test.js`

### 2. Cleaned Up Related Files
- Removed `backend-new/test-cors.js` (serverless function approach)
- Removed `backend-new/test-db.js` (serverless function approach)
- Updated `backend-new/package.json` to remove references to deleted test scripts

### 3. Verified Configuration
- Confirmed `vercel.json` correctly routes all API requests to the Express server
- Ensured Express server properly exports the app for Vercel deployment
- Verified database connection handling in `mysqlDb.js`

## Changes Made
1. **Deleted**: 11 conflicting serverless function files
2. **Modified**: `backend-new/package.json` (removed obsolete script references)
3. **Committed**: All changes with descriptive commit message
4. **Pushed**: Updates to GitHub repository

## Expected Outcome
With the conflicting serverless functions removed, Vercel should now be able to properly deploy both the frontend and backend applications without routing conflicts.

## Next Steps
1. Trigger new deployments for both frontend and backend on Vercel
2. Monitor deployment logs for any remaining issues
3. Verify that all API endpoints are working correctly
4. Test frontend functionality to ensure it can communicate with the backend

## Prevention
To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. Maintain a consistent approach for API handling (either serverless functions OR Express server, not both)
2. Regularly review and clean up unused or conflicting deployment configurations
3. Document the chosen deployment architecture clearly in project documentation
